Print settings:

All STLs are exported in their correct print orientations.

Black
- 100% infill, 5 walls: MagwellChin, PlungerRod, NStrikeLug.
- 10% infill, 5 walls: FixedStock_Buttplate, TriggerGuard.
- Everything else 20% infill, 5 walls
- Supports needed for MagwellChin and NStrikeLug. RailA/B/C has built in supports, no slicer supports required.
- MagwellChin MUST BE PRINTED WITH A BRIM AND SUPPORTS, and with the long bottom area facing the print bed. 

Green
- 100% infill, 5 walls: EndCap
- 10% infill, 5 walls: FixedStock_Stock.
- Everything else 20% infill, 5 walls
- Supports needed for BarrelShroudFront, BarrelShroudBack.
- EndCap is intended to print with the back facing the print bed, but it can be printed with the opposite face on the print bed if you enable supports.

Orange
- 20% infill, 5 walls: FrontGripKeeper, MagRelease, MuzzleNut, Trigger, PrimingBlock.
- Everything else 100% (full) infill, 5 walls
- No supports.
- Muzzle needs to be printed with the front facing the print bed.
- BarTensioner needs to be printed with the nut-cavity facing up.
- Brims are very helpful for printing all these orange parts.
- PrimingBlock has some overhangs, but nothing too awful. DO NOT USE SUPPORTS ON IT.

Misc notes:

- WATCH THE ASSEMBLY VIDEO, IT IS VERY IMPORTANT.

- Use the "PT gauge" misc print to trim a TC plunger tube to Skewer length, or check which one you have.
- Use the "BarDrillingJig A/B" to make your own bars. Glue together the two prints at the "tooth" edge. 
- Life pro tip: put the bearings into the PrimingBlock slots with needle nose pliers, its easier to line up with the pockets.
- The PrimingBlock bearing slots have adjustability, make sure its as close to the barrel/bars as possible without having undue friction. 
- Lubing the outsides of the ball bearings can make things a little bit smoother if desired.
- The little screw to keep the barrel in place is optional, the blaster works fine using just the printed muzzle nut+o-ring.
- The barrel screw goes into a square nut. The square nut goes into the front of the FrontShroud part, and is held in by a 4-40 screw next to the nut.
- If the plunger isn't catching, make sure the bars are tensioned all the way, and that you have the rubber plunger padding installed.
- The plunger uses 2x M3x16 screws, 1x M3x30 screw.
- Slide the ram into RamBaseFront before putting on the 3x 012 o-rings (two on the tip, one around the bottom, which is then squeezed by the RamBaseBack to make an air seal).
- Make sure the ram is straight when tightening the 4 locking 4-40 screws.
