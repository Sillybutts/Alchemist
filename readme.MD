Beta:
- SuperStressed: Beta testing.
- Chance: Emotional support (Chance — 06/11/2023 8:16 PM: "succa my nut", 07/07/2023 5:48 PM: "lofts can suck my whole ass"). Adapted Vikinger's Skeggox stock to fit Alchemist. Did a bunch of work on the positioning of the primingblock bearings.
- zoomed_out_tahova: Beta testing.
- Wonderboy: Misc help.
- Hollebread: Beta testing.

- Hotkoin: Aesthetic assistance.
