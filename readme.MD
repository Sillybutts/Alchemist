### Performance:
As testing is done, I will update this part of the page with common spring/barrel combos for specific FPS numbers.

Keep in mind that SCARs usually reduce performance a bit.

Expect Alchemist to hit ~20 FPS lower than a TC with an equivalent barrel and spring. Alchemist traded a shorter prime length for a smoother prime, which means there's less air volume to work with.
