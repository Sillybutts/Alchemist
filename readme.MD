## Description
Alchemist is the next step in the evolution of 3d printed pump action springers. Alchemist is built like a tank, has a butter smooth priming and firing feel, and is heavily customizable with alternative parts and upgrades. 


Firing Demo & Blaster Overview: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bPMUlzL2F4

## "Why would I build this instead of XYZ?"

* It uses ball bearings on the priming grip, and the prime is VERY smooth.
* There is an (optional) ball detent that locks the priming grip in the forward position, so it doesn't flop around while running. Flopping is an issue experienced by most pump action springers (Talon Claw, SBL, Lynx, etc etc).
* One pin and one allen key screw to access the spring, plunger, and ram.
* The blaster is built on aluminum bars, like a Lynx. Very sturdy.
   * It also has a bar tensioner, which squeezes all the parts together like a Caliburnoid. Best of both worlds.
* Hair trigger, very quick and snappy.
* The barrel can be removed and replaced in 10 seconds, toolless.
   * If you don't care about doing barrel swaps fast, there's also an optional set screw that goes directly into the barrel, for a more permanent attachment.
* Very smooth magwell with plenty of flare for quick reloading.
* Several different stock options:
   * Compatible with the SBL/Worker adjustable stock.
   * Skeggox stock (adapted from Vikinger) - this is what is pictured in the post.
   * N-Strike lug.
   * Fixed, non adjustable printed stock, with different buttplate length options
   * Or no stock, if you don't want one lol.
* A bunch of different aesthetic and ergonomic options for the shroud, grip, plunger tube area, and magwell.
* A SLAB style plunger fits wider Lynx springs, *and* all TC springs. Lots of options.
* The blaster has a 95mm prime, which is slightly shorter than a SBL, and a good bit shorter than a TC. That allows faster priming.
* Built in spring guide as the plunger rod.
* It uses a Skewer plunger tube, so it can use metal Skewer plunger tube upgrades.
* It also uses TC ramrods, so you can use fancy anodized ones.
* The rambase is improved over a TC rambase; it has more screws to grab onto the ram.
* Very easy printing, with minimal supports.
* The picatinny rail on top has a big iron sight gutter down the middle, so you can easily aim even without any picatinny irons or a proper sight.

And more I can't remember at the time of writing. Its a good blaster, build one.

Here are some good Picatinny sights if you want some:
- https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2376150/files FrontPip and Pip in the Caliburn fileset are great iron sights.

### Performance:
As testing is done, I will update this part of the page with common spring/barrel combos for specific FPS numbers.

Keep in mind that SCARs usually reduce performance a bit.

Broadly speaking, expect a reliable and consistent FPS range of 120fps to 260fps, depending on spring and barrel combo. 

Alchemist is compatible with Talon Claw length springs, as well as larger Lynx and Nerf Longshot springs.

Expect Alchemist to hit ~20 FPS lower than a TC with an equivalent barrel and spring. Alchemist traded a shorter prime length for a smoother prime, which means there's less air volume to work with.
